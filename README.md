BAX 452 - Machine Learning + Data Design and Representation

Group project by Nandini Basu, Linyan Di, Maxine Li

In the final project we use selenium, beautiful soup and YouTube APIs to web scrape various video features such as video title, description, comments, likes, dislikes, views, length etc. We then perform feature engineering and selection using NLP and regularization techniques and finally predict how various factors impact the number of views that a video gets. Please see attached reports for detailed problem structuring and business recommendations.
